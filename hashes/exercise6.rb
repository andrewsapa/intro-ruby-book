# 6. Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

# my_hash uses the new syntax for keys, using a symbol as a key

# my_hash2 uses the old syntax as well as the key representing the string
# value for x of "hi there"
